# Default is "0.#" when none is specified, this cannot be edited.

  MOVEMENT_SPEED: '0.##'
  ARMOR_TOUGHNESS: '0.###'

# Minimum and maximum values for the stat values. This means using '0 = 100'
# for CRITICAL_STRIKE_CHANCE means that you cannot have less than 0% and
# cannot have more than 100% critical strike chance. This is an important
# tool for server balance. You can balance stats like block rating, defense,
# max health, damage reduction etc.
#
# * General format is '{MINIMUM VALUE} = {MAXIMUM VALUE}'
# * Using '= {MAXIMUM VALUE}' will disable the lower bound.
# * Using '{MINIMUM VALUE} =' will disable the upper bound.
# * By default there are no upper or lower bounds for most stats. Some of
#   the following are just examples.
# * !! The minimum value IS NOT A BASE STAT VALUE. It just means that you
#   cannot have less than X in that stat (it just clamps your stat value).
#
# Default Minecraft stats like Health, Armor, Attack damage, etc.
# are PARTIALLY supported. Only the portion of these attributes
# granted by MMO plugins will be affected by these lower/upper bounds.

# This is where you can edit the base value of any stat. This has the
# exact same effect as a PERMANENT stat buff. If a MMOCore class gives
# you 20 base HP, and if the base value in this config section is set
# to 10, it will result in 20 + 10 = 30 HP. It also works like that
# with MMOItems items as well.
#
# This is also an important tool for balancing your player stats.
#
# !! If this value is lower than your minimum stat value, it is most
# likely useless because your stat value will not be buffed.
#
# The default base stat for any stat is 0, this cannot be edited.
